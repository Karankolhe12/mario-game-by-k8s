Super Mario Kubernetes Deployment with AWS EKS 🌟
Are you ready to embark on a nostalgic journey back to the golden era of 90's gaming? Let's relive the excitement and thrill with none other than the iconic Super Mario game! 🍄

Introduction
In this guide, we'll explore the exhilarating process of deploying Super Mario on Amazon’s Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), harnessing the power of Kubernetes for scalability, reliability, and seamless management. 🚀

Prerequisites
To get started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

Ubuntu Instance: A Linux instance to deploy resources.
IAM Role: An IAM role with necessary permissions.
Terraform: Installed on the instance.
AWS CLI and Kubectl: Installed on the instance.
Dockerfile: Prepare a Dockerfile for packaging the Super Mario game.
Deployment files: Create Kubernetes deployment files for orchestrating the game.
Terraform scripts: Craft Terraform scripts for provisioning infrastructure on AWS EKS.
Getting Started
Step 1: 🚀 Launch Ubuntu instance
Start your journey by launching an Ubuntu instance on AWS EC2. This will be your staging ground for setting up the Super Mario deployment environment.

Step 2: 🔑 Create IAM role
Craft an IAM role like a key to a treasure chest. This role will grant the necessary permissions for your EC2 instance to interact with AWS services seamlessly.

Step 3: 🛠️ Cluster Provisioning
Let's sculpt your Kubernetes cluster like a master artisan. Utilize Terraform to bring your cluster to life, and update the Kubernetes configuration to ensure everything fits snugly in place.

Step 4: 🐳 Dockerize Super Mario
Package Super Mario into a Docker container using the Dockerfile you've prepared. This will ensure portability and consistency in your deployment.

Step 5: 🚢 Deploy Super Mario
Deploy Super Mario onto your Kubernetes cluster using the deployment files you've crafted. Watch as Mario springs to life in the cloud!

Destruction
Remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Don't forget to tear down your environment once you've had your fill of nostalgia!
